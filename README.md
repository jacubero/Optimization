## Target audience
Data scientists, engineers, computer scientists, economists, and in general, professionals with a background in mathematical modeling and a basic knowledge of Python.

## Goals of modeling examples
+ Illustrate the broad applicability of mathematical optimization.
+ Show how to build mathematical optimization models.

These modeling examples are coded using python and distributed as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Basic examples

- [Knapsack:](knapsack)
  In the knapsack problem, you need to pack a set of items, with given values and sizes (such as weights or volumes), into a container with a maximum capacity. If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, you can't pack them all. In that case, the problem is to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.

- [Facility Location:](facility_location)
  In this example, we will show you how to tackle a facility location problem that involves determining the number and location of warehouses that are needed to supply a group of supermarkets.
